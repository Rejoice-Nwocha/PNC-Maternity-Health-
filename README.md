## Overview

> *“Every data point is a mother, a family, a future.”*

This project investigates global **Postnatal Care (PNC)** trends to understand why maternal mortality remains one of the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age worldwide — and what the data tells us about where care is failing most.

Using open health datasets spanning 100+ countries, I built a multi-dimensional Power BI dashboard that tracks PNC coverage across **age groups, income levels, wealth quintiles, and geographic regions** — revealing clear, actionable patterns that could inform health policy, funding decisions, and community programmes.

The central question driving this analysis:

> **Could strengthening postnatal care help save more mothers and address the global birth rate crisis?**

## The Problem

Maternal death remains a **leading cause of death for women of reproductive age globally**. The postnatal period — the weeks immediately after birth — is the most vulnerable window for new mothers. Yet in many parts of the world, this critical window is consistently overlooked.

Key findings from the data:

- Postnatal care coverage is **lowest among adolescent mothers (ages 15–19)** — who represent only **11%** of PNC recipients despite being among the highest-risk group
- Countries with **limited PNC access** consistently show higher maternal mortality rates
- Lack of postnatal follow-up leads to **unidentified complications, delayed treatment, and preventable deaths**
- The **lowest wealth quintile** receives the least postnatal care — with coverage dropping sharply compared to the highest income group
- Progress in **urban areas far outpaces rural zones**, widening the infrastructure divide

## Dashboard Breakdown

The Power BI dashboard covers five analytical dimensions:

|Visual                                                 |Insight                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Global PNC Trends Over Time**                        |Coverage fluctuated between 2012–2021, peaking mid-decade before declining|
|**PNC Coverage by Age Group**                          |89% aged 15–49 vs. only 11% for adolescents aged 15–19                    |
|**Postnatal Care by Country**                          |Eastern Europe & Central Asia lead; Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly |
|**PNC by Wealth Quintile**                             |Highest quintile = 70% coverage; Lowest quintile = 41% coverage           |
|**Maternal Deaths by Lack of PNC**                     |Direct correlation visible between low PNC access and elevated mortality  |
|**Regional Maternal Deaths by World Bank Income Group**|Low-income East African and West/Central African regions most affected    |

## Key Insights & Policy Implications

**1. Adolescent mothers are the most underserved group.**
With only 11% PNC coverage among 15–19 year olds, this demographic faces disproportionate risk. Targeted outreach programmes and school-linked health services could significantly close this gap.

**2. Wealth predicts access.**
The steep drop in PNC coverage from the highest to lowest wealth quintile (70% → 41%) reflects systemic barriers — cost, distance, and lack of community health infrastructure. Subsidised or community-based PNC models are critical.

**3. Geography drives disparity.**
Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia remain the most underserved regions. Countries investing in renewable energy and electrification (see SDG7 project) often show parallel improvements in healthcare access — highlighting the interconnected nature of development goals.

**4. Data can drive advocacy.**
Organisations like WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and national health ministries can use insights like these to direct funding, design community programmes, and build evidence-based maternal health strategies — especially in low-resource settings.

|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Data Collection**|Sourced open datasets from WHO, World Bank, and UNICEF maternal health indicators                  |
|**Data Cleaning**  |Handled missing values, standardised country names, restructured time-series data in Excel         |
|**Analysis**       |Identified trends by age, region, income group, and wealth quintile                                |
|**Visualisation**  |Built multi-page Power BI dashboard with line charts, donut charts, bar charts, and regional tables|

## Who This Is For

This analysis is relevant for:

- 🏥 **Health ministries and policymakers** designing maternal health strategies
- 🌍 **NGOs and development organisations** (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, Save the Children)
- 📊 **Data teams in health-focused institutions** seeking evidence for funding proposals
- 🎓 **Researchers** studying maternal mortality and reproductive health disparities

## Let’s Use Data Not Just to Analyse — But to Advocate

Every percentage point in this dashboard represents real women, real families, and real futures. The goal of this project is not just analytical — it’s to demonstrate how business intelligence tools can be applied to global health challenges to surface insights that matter.
